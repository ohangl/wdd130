                <p>Hello everyone! My name is Angela Chacon, and I am from San Juan, Argentina. I am 23 years old.
                    I enjoy painting and writting as hobbies, and also reading books. My favourite colors are black and yellow. 
                     I served my mission in the pandemic time so I had been part of 4 different missions.
                     Music is my go-to for relaxation. Whether it's listening to jazz or playing the piano, music always lifts my spirits.
                      I have a pet which name is Dolar, he is a grey cat and he is my companion in everything. I love him as my brother.
                      I live with my mom, stepfather, my brother and my sister. 
                      I really enjoy study languages. I am studying English, French, Italian and I really want to learn an asian laguage like chinese or korean.
                     Nice to meet you! 
                </p>
